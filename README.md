# GitHub Trending Display
A lab for the course TDDC73 Interaction Programming. This is a React Native app that uses GitHub's REST API to display a list of popular repositories. Users can filter repositories by language and a new page with detailed information about the repository appears when users click on a list item.

## How to run
You will need your own GitHub access token and put it in a .env file in the root directory, like "GITHUB_TOKEN=token" where "token" is your access token.

Run by navigating to the root directory and run "npm run web".
